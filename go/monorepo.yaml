language: gi  # must agree with directory name and root manifest
description: Golang language manifest
platforms:
  - macos
  - linux
tasks:
  # language-specific parameters.
  #   - If any task is null, it is not supported currently.
  #   - This should be the command or array of commands which will
  #     execute for each feature.
  #   - We should implement all steps by executing commands through monorepo exec
  #     (written in golang for cross-platform execution).  This keeps the language
  #     build process abstracted from the platform/CPU.
  #
  build:
    - monorepo exec go "build -o{TARGET_DIR}/{PROJECT_NAME}/{PROGRAM_NAME}{EXTENSION} {SOURCE_PATH}/main.go"
  linter:
    - monorepo exec go "vet -v ./..." --working_dir ./go/projects
    - monorepo exec go "vet -v ./..." --working_dir ./go/cmd
  tester:
    - monorepo exec go "test -v ./..." --working_dir ./go/projects
    - monorepo exec go "test -v ./..." --working_dir ./go/cmd
  signing: # feature is empty and not currently supported
