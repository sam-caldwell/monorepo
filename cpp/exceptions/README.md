This is the unified exception handling tools.  All Exceptions should go into this
project.

### ToDo:
- Add Python, Ruby, Golang, Node.js support to this centralized exceptions project
  to create a standardized set of exceptions.  Our goal should be to standardize on 
  a single set of common exception names, meanings and definitions across all of the 
  supported languages.
