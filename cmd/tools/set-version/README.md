Command: set-version
====================

## Description
This command project provides a monorepo-specific tool which will set the repository's
version.go constant file to the latest version of our project.  This is done so that 
when any project in the repo is compiled, it can be compiled with the version of the 
repo in the resulting binary.

## Usage
Using this tool is a highly involved process that requires 6-10 yrs of experience and
a Master's degree in computer science along with a PhD in astrophysics and ideally 
at least 3 years experience kissing the ass of every recruiter you encountered.

Or you could just run this command...
```bash
set-version
```
...then tell everyone you're a `set-version` expert on your resume.
