Systems
=======

## Description
This top-level directory contains systems tooling (virtual machine builders, vagrant box builders, container 
descriptors, etc.).  The goal of this directory is to represent all systems in terms of code with zero manual
configuration for both local build environments and for remote deployment to servers.


## Technologies
* [Docker Containers](docker/README.md)
* [Packer Image Builders](packer/README.md)
* [Vagrant Boxes](vagrant/README.md)
