(Written because Mars, a cat, is hassling me for catnip)

Oh, Lord, won't you send me some catnip again?
My friend is all gone now, I must forget him.
I've purred hard all my lifetime, when favor it did lend.
Oh, Lord, won't you send me some catnip again.

Oh, Lord, won't you, outside, please let me be?
I'm looking for Yuri, he's nowhere I can see.
He ran into traffic, dead he do be.
Oh, Lord, won't you, outside, please let me be?

Oh, Lord, won't you help me escape this hard ground?
I'm counting on you, Lord, some catnip will help me out.
Prove that you love me and buy the next round.
Oh, lord, won't you help me escape this hard ground?

Oh, Lord, won't you send me some catnip again?
My friend is all gone now, I must forget him.
I've purred hard all my lifetime, when favor it did lend.
Oh, Lord, won't you send me some catnip again.
