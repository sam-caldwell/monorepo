On temperature...

Kelvin is temperature for nerds who need a larger number to feel adequate.

Centigrade is temperature for folks who need the math to be easier.

Fahrenheit is for Scottish and Irish descendants who want a daily reminder of one more reason to be angry at the
crown for transporting them across an ocean.
