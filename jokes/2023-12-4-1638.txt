A mathematician goes nuts and is committed to a psychiatric hospital.  Every time a new patient comes into the
hospital, he runs up to the new person and screams "DIFFERENTIATE YOURSELF!" repeatedly until the new person
freaks out and runs away.

One day a new patient is admitted.  The older mathematician runs up and screams "DIFFERENTIATE YOURSELF!"  But the
new patient does nothing.  The man screams again "DIFFERENTIATE YOURSELF!"  Again nothing.  Finally after several more
attempts, the mathematician stops and asks "Why don't you run away like the rest?"

The new patient smiles and says "I'm e^x, you have no power over me."
