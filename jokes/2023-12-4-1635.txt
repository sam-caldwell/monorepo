An engineer and a mathematician share an office. One day, their shared waste bin catches fire, and the engineer
pours his coffee on it, putting it out. The next week, the engineer is on vacation, and the waste bin
catches fire again.

The mathematician goes to the kitchen, gets a cup of coffee, announces, “a solution exists!” and goes back to work.
