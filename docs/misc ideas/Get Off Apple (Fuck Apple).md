(If you're currently working for Apple and read this, it took a decade of frustrations for me to finally get mad enough to finally just say "It's YOU not me.  Bye!")
## Problem:
1. Apple's EULA is more creepy than the old dude on Family Guy....  Just too invasive.
2. Apple's customer service and quality has dropped over the last decade (RIP Steve Jobs).

## Solution: 
* Get off my ass and go back to Linux...
* By 31 Jul 2024, get off all authenticator apps and replace with hardware tokens.
* By 31 Dec 2024, get the fuck off Apple's devices (with possible exception of iPhone).
* By 31 Dec 2025, get off Apple iPhone and be done with them once and for all.
* By 31 Dec 2026, document my alternatives to Apple and evangelize non-Apple solutions hard enough to make Guy Kawasaki look like an amateur because...Apple is not the company the two Steves started.

## Constraints
* No Google solution...Android scares me more than iPhone.
* No Microsoft solutions because ...well...  M$ ain't going my direction.
* The solution should be Open Source and free me from the network and from the subscription racket.


## Laptop

Hardware:
* Existing Thinkpad linux laptop (switch it to Kubuntu)
* Format the Mac Book pro to Kubuntu.
