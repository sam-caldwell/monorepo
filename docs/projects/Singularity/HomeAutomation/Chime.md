## MVP Features
1. Device listens on https://0.0.0.0:443/
2. When HTTP/GET is rec'd, service responds with HTTP/200 OK
3. When HTTP/PUT is rec'd, service closes circuit to cause the doorbell chime to ring.

## Nice-to-Have
1. This should be a speaker.  The speaker should tell me which doorbell was pressed.
