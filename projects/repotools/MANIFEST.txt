# windows.disabled: need a comment here because it's ignored
# linux.disabled: the fact that this line is commented out should make it inert
# darwin.disabled: but if we were to remove the # comment, then this line's existence would disable something
# project.disabled: for example 'project.disabled' would disable the entire project.
