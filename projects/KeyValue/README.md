KeyValue Map
============

## Description
A struct and methods for working with maps of key-value data
that doesn't involve redoing the same efforts over and over,
repeating yourself again and again...endlessly. :-)

<div>
<h1 style="color:red">Warning:</h1>

<p style="color:red">
    The KeyValue project is based on a map, and as such
    The order of elements in the KeyValue object are not 
    guaranteed at all.
</p>
</div>
