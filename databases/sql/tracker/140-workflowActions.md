Workflow Actions
================

## Objectives
* For every `workflow` there are `workflowSteps` representing the state of a `ticket` at a given time.  These steps 
  may represent a state in the workflow, or they may represent a state when an action should be taken in the 
  background.  These actions are represented as actions in `workflowActions` as reusable objects.
